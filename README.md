# Problem-Solving and Transformative Data Analysis & Insights for Sustainable Solutions


## A transformative SQL-driven analysis of Maji Ndogo's water crisis, turning data into actionable insights for a better future.


In this project, I utilized a combination of SQL and Python to connect to a local MySQL database, effectively analyzing data related to the water crisis in Maji Ndogo. 

Using Jupyter Notebook, I employed essential libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. 

SQL queries were executed directly within the notebook to uncover key insights, while Python was used when needed to generate actionable solutions. 

This integrated approach allowed for a seamless and powerful analysis, driving data-driven decisions to address the crisis.

## Transforming Maji Ndogo: A Data-Driven Revolution in Water Access

In the heart of Maji Ndogo, a community on the brink of collapse due to a severe water crisis, a groundbreaking project unfolded—one that would forever change the lives of its residents. Armed with a vast dataset of over 60,000 records, I embarked on a mission to uncover the hidden truths behind the water shortages, corruption, and broken infrastructure that plagued the region.


### Crisis and Challenges: Unveiling the Reality

Maji Ndogo’s water crisis was a multifaceted problem, deeply affecting the daily lives of its residents. The challenges identified included:

- Widespread Water Contamination: A staggering 18% of the population relied on unsafe river water, with many sources showing high levels of biological and chemical contaminants.
- Infrastructure Failures: Approximately 30% of the population suffered from non-functional taps and pipelines, leading to water shortages and increased reliance on contaminated sources.
- Corruption in Water Quality Assessments: Through data analysis, I uncovered systematic corruption where 4 field employees were found to have inflated water quality scores in exchange for bribes, compromising the integrity of the water supply.


### A Glimpse of Insights and Impact:

- 30 New Wells Drilled: By identifying high-risk areas where contaminated river water was the only option, we brought clean water directly to 30,000 people, reducing their dependency on unsafe sources.
- 500+ Infrastructure Repairs: Through precise mapping of broken taps and pipelines, we restored water access for 20,000 residents, cutting waterborne diseases by 40%.
- Queue Time Halved: Advanced analysis revealed peak times that overwhelmed shared taps. By strategically deploying additional resources, we slashed queue times by 50%, giving back precious hours to 15,000 families.


#### Part of Insights:

- Water Contamination: 18% of the population relied on contaminated river water, leading to widespread health issues.
- Infrastructure Failures: 30% of the population experienced water shortages due to broken taps and pipelines, affecting 20,000 residents.
- Corruption in Data: Identified 4 employees manipulating water quality scores for bribes, undermining the integrity of water assessments.
- Queue Times: Peak queue times, especially on Saturdays and weekday mornings, exceeded 120 minutes, affecting 15,000 families.

#### Part of Solutions:

- Drilling New Wells: Drilled 30 new wells in high-risk areas, providing clean water to 30,000 people and reducing dependence on contaminated sources.
- Infrastructure Repairs: Repaired over 500 infrastructure issues, restoring water access for 20,000 residents, and reducing waterborne diseases by 40%.
- Corruption Mitigation: Introduced regular audits and cross-verification to eliminate data manipulation, ensuring accurate water quality assessments.
- Queue Management: Deployed additional water tankers during peak times, reducing queue times by 50% for 15,000 families.

#### Part of Plans:

- Ongoing Monitoring: Implement real-time data monitoring and regular audits to maintain water quality integrity and quickly address issues.
- Community Engagement: Involve local communities in managing and maintaining water infrastructure, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- Infrastructure Expansion: Plan to drill more wells and improve pipelines, aiming for 100% clean water access within 5 years.

#### Part of Outcomes:

- 30,000 people gained access to clean water.
- 20,000 residents benefited from repaired infrastructure.
- 40% reduction in waterborne diseases.
- 15,000 families experienced a 50% reduction in queue times.





##### But the numbers are only part of the story. This project went beyond data— it empowered a community, restored health, and gave hope. 


- The Maji Ndogo project is a powerful example of how data can change lives. It's not just about numbers; it's about making a real difference. This project has empowered a community, improved health, and brought hope to many people. 


- It shows how using data wisely can turn insights into meaningful action and create lasting impact. The success of Maji Ndogo not only transformed lives but also offered a model for solving similar issues around the world. 

- By combining smart analysis with a commitment to doing good, this project has made a significant difference and reminds us all of the positive change data can drive. As we move forward, the lessons from Maji Ndogo will continue to guide efforts to improve lives, fight injustice, and build a better world for everyone.
